# visualnination
Repository for visualization of data around Nina. Contains data and some
scripts for processing.

## visualization
Prototyping on ObservableHQ:
[https://observablehq.com/d/463c5dc2bcae4d6e](https://observablehq.com/d/463c5dc2bcae4d6e)

## scripts
Requires [deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/) installed.

Convert the `nina.yaml` file to JSON:
```
deno task convert
```

## plan

I want to make an app that would allow us to interactively browser through all
the photos, diary logs, and data that we collected with or about Nina.

Plan is to make that semi-public, so that grandparents can browser through too.
